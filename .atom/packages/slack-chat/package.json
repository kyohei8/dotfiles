You can acquire a token under authentication here https://api.slack.com/ \n### Username\nThe slack api doesn't operate as the user who is sending requests but as a bot that is sending \nrequests on behalf of the user. For this reason, you'll need to specify a username to be used.\nIf you use the same username as you have specified on Slack, you will see your username show up as\n\"*\\#{username} (bot)*\". \"(bot)\" will not appear if your username is not the same as your Slack username.\n### Real Time Messaging\nSlack Chat can accept and send messages in real time--with a catch. To receive notifications and carry \non real time conversations you will need to:\n- Install the accompanying chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slack-chat/lhdjcloiphabhhodmcclbfhcehfddlpc?authuser=1\n- Keep a Slack tab open \n- Refresh Slack until you see the `Slack Chat is running` banner.",
